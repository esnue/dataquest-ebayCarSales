    "A dataset with 50,000 datapoints will be used that has been scraped from the German eBay section's website. The aim of this project is to analyze the included used car listings after the dataset has been cleaned. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "The data dictionary provided with data is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dateCrawled` - When this ad was first crawled. All field-values are taken from this date.\n",
    "- `name` - Name of the car.\n",
    "- `seller` - Whether the seller is private or a dealer.\n",
    "- `offerType` - The type of listing\n",
    "- `price` - The price on the ad to sell the car.\n",
    "- `abtest` - Whether the listing is included in an A/B test.\n",
    "- `vehicleType` - The vehicle Type.\n",
    "- `yearOfRegistration` - The year in which the car was first registered.\n",
    "- `gearbox` - The transmission type.\n",

    "- `brand` - The brand of the car.\n",
    "- `notRepairedDamage` - If the car has a damage which is not yet repaired.\n",
    "- `dateCreated` - The date on which the eBay listing was created.\n",
    "- `nrOfPictures` - The number of pictures in the ad.\n",
    "- `postalCode` - The postal code for the location of the vehicle.\n",

    "The reason why Mini is the most expensive brand seems to be the relatively low average mileage, which is at ca. 88,000 km. \"Sonstige Autos\" (aggregated other brands) shows an even higher mean price with a comparable mean mileage. Hence, there seems to be an inverse correlation between mileage and price of used cars. Nevertheless, this doesn't seem to be a very consistent relationship; f.e. Audi cars are among the most expensive brands, but show almost the same mean mileage than the much cheaper Ford cars (129157.39 km vs. 124266.24\n"
